Hi! I am a Chemical Engineering PhD student at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</a> beginning from 2020. My supervisor is Prof. <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/mani-sarathy"> Mani-Sarathy</a>. 
Prior to KAUST, I got my M.S degree in Physical Chemistry supervised by Prof. <a href="https://tcc.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">Weixue Li</a> and B.S degree in Physical Materials both at <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>. 

My research interest includes computational chemistry, machine learning and large language models for heterogeneous catalysis, chemical mechanism and materials design. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [tairan.wang@kaust.edu.sa](mailto:tairan.wang@kaust.edu.sa).

*I am expected to graduate in June 2024. I am currently on the job market!*
